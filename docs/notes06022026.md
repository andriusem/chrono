1. Data Hierarchy & Structure
1.1 Global Level (ILYA): The software must maintain a global "ILYA" dashboard that aggregates data (hours and progress) from all active projects.
1.2 Project Library: The system contain a master list of Projects. This is where the PM starts setting the management system. 
1.3 Domain Library: The system must contain a master list of 12 Domains (e.g., Governance, Finance, Communications) that serve as templates for project setup.
1.4 Activity Level: Each Domain must contain a set of predefined "Activities." Activities can be removed or added manaually. 
1.5 Task Level: Tasks are the granular units of work created by users or/and assigned by PM under specific Activities.
1.6 Project Segregation: The system must allow for "General" domains (always visible/global) and "Project-Specific" domains (only visible within a project).
1.7 Projects -> Domains -> Activities -> Tasks

2. Project Setup & Configuration
2.1 Template-Based Setup: When creating a new project, a PM (Project Manager) must select which Domains from the master library apply to that project.
2.2 Customization: The setup must allow the PM to delete or hide Activities that are unnecessary, for a specific Domain they have selected before, to reduce clutter.
2.3 The Tasks are created in the page with kanban and grid view that is only for tasks. Other entities must have the grid and list views.  
2.4 Structure Persistence: The core structure of Kanban (In Progress, Done, etc.) must be "hardcoded" or restricted so that users cannot change the fundamental workflow.

3. Time Tracking & "Clocking" Logic
3.1 Global Clock-In: Users must "Clock In" to the system before they are permitted to start any specific task or activity.
3.2 Task Timer: Each task must have a "Start" and "Stop" button.
3.3 Minimum Increment: The system must record time in 15-minute minimum increments (e.g., a 2-minute task is billed as 15 minutes).
3.4 Daily Reconciliation: If a user fails to "Clock Out" at the end of a shift, the system must prevent them from starting new work the following day until they have resolved/filled in the previous day's missing time.
3.5 Status Pop-ups (Heartbeat): Every 30 minutes, the system must trigger a pop-up window asking, "Are you still working on this?"
3.6 If the user clicks "Yes," the timer continues. If the user clicks "No" or fails to respond within a 5-minute grace period, the task timer must automatically stop and the user is clocked out of the task.

4. Kanban & Task Management
4.1 Automated Transitions: Clicking the "Start" button on a task in the backlog must automatically move that task to the "In Progress" column.
4.2 Finished Logic: A "Finished" button must be available. Clicking it stops the timer and moves the task to the "Done" or "Completed" column.
4.3 Stop vs. Pause:
4.4 "Stop" pauses the timer but keeps the task in the "In Progress" column. "Finish" terminates the task.
4.5 Task Ownership: Users must be able to add tasks themselves, but all tasks within a project must be visible to the entire team to prevent duplication.

5. Prioritization & Automation
5.1 Weighted Prioritization: Tasks must be organized based on a ponderation (weighted score) of Urgency and Importance.
Logic Gap Fill: The system should use a 1–5 scale for both metrics. The "Priority Score" = (Urgency x Importance). Tasks with the highest score automatically float to the top of the list.
5.2 Deadline Integration: Deadlines must act as a secondary criteria for the prioritization algorithm.
5.3 Recurring Tasks: The system must support recurring activities (e.g., weekly classes).
5.4 Once a recurring task is marked "Finished," the system must automatically create a new instance of that task in the "To-Do" column for the following week/day/month. 
5.5 When the task is created there should be an option to make it reacuring (daily/weekly/monthly)

6. User Experience (UI/UX)
6.1 Perspective Toggle:
Project Page (List/Grid views): Provides a "Big Picture" view of all domains. Each project has the same list of domains. 
Domains Page (List/Grid views): Provides a "Big Picture" view of all Activities per selected domain.  
Activities Page (List/Grid views): List of activities per each domain.   
Tasks Page (Kanban view only): Provides a "Tunnel Vision" view focused purely on task execution. 
6.2 PM View: Project managers must have a specific view to monitor all employee spaces and shared tasks.
6.3 The employees only see their own tasks in the kanban but they also should be able to see general view where they can add new tasks to the activity and other employees can claim these tasks. 

1. Project Setup & Data Hierarchy
1.2 Domain-Based Structure: Users must select from different Domains, each containing a unique set of Activities.
1.3 Then they must select unique activities from different domains.
1.4 Project Initialization: During the "project set up" phase, the PM goes through these domains to select only the domains related to that specific project.
1.5 Furthemore they must add tasks to each activity. 
1.6 Automated Configuration: Once selected, these tasks are automatically pulled into the tasks page to form its operational structure.

2. UI Perspectives (Grid vs. Kanban)
The Grid/List Views (Big Picture): This is the high-level project management space. It is used for oversight and creating tasks under the selected activities.
The Kanban View (Tunnel Vision): This is the execution space for employees. It focuses strictly on active tasks to avoid information overload.
Team Transparency: A general view must be available for all employees so everyone can see project-wide progress and what others are working on.
PM dashboard: PM must have a granular view on what each employee is working on at any selected time.

3. Operational Workflow & Kanban Logic
Start Restrictions: Tasks can only be started from within the Kanban view to ensure the workflow is tracked correctly.
Automated Movement: When a user pushes "Start" on a task, the system must automatically move that task into the "In Progress" column in the Kanban board.
Integration (Outlook calendar): The software should connect to Outlook, allowing a task to be converted into a meeting or calendar event automatically.

4. Time Tracking & Access Control
Clock-Out Enforcement: The system follows a "No Clock-Out, No Access" rule. If a user does not clock out at the end of their shift, they are barred from accessing or starting new tasks the following day until the previous day's time is reconciled.
5. Task Prioritization
Eisenhower Logic: Tasks do not appear randomly; they are automatically sorted in the Kanban view based on a priority order of Importance + Urgency.

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- The new set up is not based on the Teams as integration option anymore. It will be a standalone desktop app or a PWA.
